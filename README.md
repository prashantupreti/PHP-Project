## What is this?
This is a PHP project I worked on when I was learning web development in 2017. It has user panel and admin panel. User can get notifications and messages. User can enter each other and communicate. Every user account needs to be first verified by admin so that one can create an account in the server. 

## Features:
1.Dynamic index.php page (content are edited by admins)
2.Login feature with two portals, one for Users another for Admins. 
3.Users can post blog posts, edit their info, update password, and in near future update their security questions in order to restore their forgotten password.
4.Admins can approve the users blog post, edit and have a whole background info of its user, but hasn't got any right to see the password which is encrypted with MD5.
5.Every approved blog posts from admins gets posted in blogs.php file.
6.The index.php page has the about information of the admins.

## Something to know:
